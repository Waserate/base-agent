# Base Airdrop Agent

Automated DeFi farming agent for Base chain. Supplies, borrows, and manages positions across 88+ platforms to maximize on-chain activity for potential airdrops.

## Supported Platforms

**Lending/Supply:** Compound v3, Fluid, Moonwell, Spark, Morpho, Beefy, AAVE v3  
**Borrowing:** Compound v3 Borrow, Fluid T1 Vault, Moonwell Borrow, AAVE v3 Borrow  
**LP:** Aerodrome (9 pools), Uniswap v3 (10 pools), PancakeSwap v3 (13 pools)  
**Other:** Aerodrome veAERO vote, ERC20 deploy, Megapot lottery

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Base mainnet wallet with ETH
- (Optional) Alchemy API key for pool discovery

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd base-agent
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in WALLET_ADDRESS, WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY, etc.

# Configure wallets
cp wallets.json.example wallets.json
# Edit wallets.json — add your wallet(s)
```

## Quick Start (Windows)

### Step 1 — Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 — Get an Alchemy API key (free)

1. Go to [https://www.alchemy.com](https://www.alchemy.com) → **Sign up** (free account)
2. Click **Create new app** → choose **Base** as the network
3. Copy the **HTTPS** endpoint URL (looks like `https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`)
4. Paste it into `.env` as `DISCOVERY_RPC_URL=<your URL>`

> Without this, LP pool discovery is skipped — agent still works but may miss some Uniswap/PancakeSwap pools.

### Step 3 — Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in WALLET_ADDRESS, WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY, and DISCOVERY_RPC_URL
```

### Step 4 — Configure wallets
```bash
cp wallets.json.example wallets.json
# Edit wallets.json — add your wallet (id, address, private_key)
```

### Step 5 — Launch
Double-click **`start.bat`** — opens Agent CMD + Dashboard CMD + browser automatically.

```
start.bat
```

> `.env` and `wallets.json` are **not included in the repo** (contain private keys). Steps 3–4 are required before first run.

## Running (Manual)

```bash
# Start dashboard (localhost:8766)
python serve_dashboard.py

# Run agent (daily scheduler)
python agent.py

# Manual: supply 1-2 random platforms now
python run_now.py

# Dry run (no real TX)
DRY_RUN=true python run_now.py

# Check active positions
python check_positions.py

# Withdraw all positions → ETH
python withdraw_all.py
```

## Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:8766/dashboard.html` after starting `serve_dashboard.py`.

Features:
- Live position values (USD)
- Today's plan + schedule
- Health monitor (borrow safety)
- Multi-wallet support
- Action log + rule validation log

## Configuration

All config in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `WALLET_ADDRESS` | Your wallet address |
| `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` | Your private key |
| `BASE_RPC_URL` | Base RPC (default: mainnet.base.org) |
| `DISCOVERY_RPC_URL` | Alchemy RPC for pool discovery (optional) |
| `MIN_ETH_BALANCE` | Stop if ETH below this (gas reserve) |
| `DRY_RUN` | `true` = simulate only, no TX |
| `DASHBOARD_PIN` | Dashboard action PIN (default: 0000) |
| `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PIN` | Dashboard admin PIN (default: 0000) |

## Safety

- Positions are capped at ~$5-15 USD each
- Health monitor closes borrows automatically if health < 1.5x
- `MIN_ETH_BALANCE` reserves ETH for gas at all times
- All TX use 5x gas buffer to prevent drops
- On-chain recovery reconciles DB with chain state on every startup

## Multi-Wallet

Add wallets via the dashboard ⊕ button, or manually edit `wallets.json` (see `wallets.json.example`).

Agent currently executes one wallet at a time. Multi-wallet parallel execution is planned.

## Changelog

### 2026-06-06
- **start.bat**: launcher script — opens Agent CMD + Dashboard + browser in one click
- **start.bat**: kill only Base Agent/Dashboard windows, not all Python processes
- **aero_vote on-chain guard**: before entering new lock, scan wallet's veAERO NFTs on-chain via `ownerOf` range scan + `balanceOf` check — prevents duplicate positions even if DB is out of sync
- **aero_vote orphan reconcile**: if NFT found on-chain but missing in DB, auto-insert into DB and skip new enter
- **aero_vote price sanity**: reject if AERO price is outside \$0.05–\$50 range (guards against stale oracle returning wrong price)
- **aero_vote USD cap**: hard cap at \$10 USD per lock regardless of config value
- **aero_vote lock formula fix**: corrected epoch rounding — `lock_days=7` now locks exactly 1 epoch (~7 days) instead of 2 epochs (~14 days) due to off-by-one in `+1` formula
- **aero_vote in random candidate pool**: ENTER is randomly selected by the rule engine like any other platform — no forced re-entry after exit; maintenance job handles EXIT only
- **swap STF fix**: `swap_token_to_eth` now reads actual on-chain token balance before swap and caps `amount_in_wei` to it — prevents `SafeTransferFrom` revert when protocol fees cause withdrawn amount to be less than what state.db recorded
- **swap dust skip**: skip swap if DEX quote output < 0.0001 ETH (~$0.35) to avoid wasting gas on dust amounts
- **429 RPC fix**: agent now uses Alchemy (`DISCOVERY_RPC_URL`) for all TX calls when configured, eliminating `Too Many Requests` errors on public mainnet.base.org — **requires agent restart to take effect**
- **daily_job withdraw crash fix**: moved `int(float(amount_wei))` parse inside the try/except in `daily_job` (run_now.py path) — a non-numeric `amount_wei` (aero_vote `tokenId|wei`, psm_hold `psm_hold_<bal>`) no longer raises an uncaught `ValueError` that aborted the entire expired-withdraw loop
- **expiry override fix**: lend/aero_lp/beefy supply types now honor the plan's custom expiry instead of recomputing the default — the loop only recomputes expiry on a repick (when the override no longer applies)
- **aero_vote address fix**: corrected `aero_vote.address` in contracts.json to the canonical VotingEscrow `0xeBf418Fe2512e7E6...` (was a wrong address only referenced by debug scripts; execution path already used the correct one)
- **erc4626 dust fix**: `erc4626_withdraw_all` now uses `redeem(shares)` instead of `withdraw(convertToAssets(shares))` — burns the exact share balance, returns all underlying, leaves zero dust shares, and avoids the rounding edge that can revert "withdraw more than max"
- **compound dust fix**: `compound_withdraw` now reads the current Comet `balanceOf` (principal + accrued interest) and withdraws that, instead of the originally-deposited amount — leaves zero dust in the protocol
